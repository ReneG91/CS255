DriverPass Project Reflection

Brief Summary
The DriverPass project was for a client that wanted to improve how students prepare for their driving exams. The system needed to provide online practice exams, lesson scheduling, and on-the-road training management. The client wanted a secure, flexible, and user-friendly platform that could support students, instructors, and administrators.

What I Did Well
I did particularly well in identifying both functional and nonfunctional requirements. This helped ensure the design not only met the client’s feature needs but also covered security, performance, and adaptability. I also created UML diagrams that clearly represented the system’s interactions, making it easier to explain the design to nontechnical audiences.

What I Would Revise
If I could revise one part, I would refine the activity diagrams to better show alternative paths, such as what happens if a student cancels a reservation. Improving this would make the diagrams more realistic and complete, giving developers a clearer guide to follow.

Interpreting User Needs
I interpreted the user’s needs by paying attention to the interview transcript and mapping each requirement—like booking lessons, secure login, and progress tracking—into system components. Considering user needs is critical because it ensures the system actually solves the problems it was meant to address, rather than just meeting technical goals.

Approach to Designing Software
When designing software, I approach it by breaking the system into smaller, manageable pieces and using diagrams to model both the structure and processes. I rely on object-oriented concepts for organization, process models for workflows, and constant validation against user requirements. In the future, I would continue using UML, requirements analysis, and iteration to design systems while making sure to involve user feedback early.
